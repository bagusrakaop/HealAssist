    "The dataset used in this project is survey data from BRFSS in 2021. This BRFSS dataset contains 438,693 records. We only take a few variables in this dataset that are related to a person's lifestyle and its relationship with any cardiovascular disease. This dataset is originally in SAS Transport Formats. We converted it from SAS Transport Formats data to csv to make it lighter and easier to use.\n",

    "The method of retrieving this dataset was inspired by [1] which also retrieved data from BRFSS to examine its relationship with cardiovascular disease. However, we customized the variables used. There are some variables that we added or subtracted from reference [1]. Furthermore, to understand the meaning of each variable code, we read the more detailed questionnaire in [2](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf-ques/2021-BRFSS-Questionnaire-1-19-2022-508.pdf). \n",

We will change the coding that tends to be complicated in this data such as in the WEIGHT2 and HEIGHT3 columns to equalize the metrics used. Furthermore, also in the columns ALCDAY5, FRUIT2, FRUITJU2, FVGREEN1, FRENCHF1, POTATOE1, and VEGETAB2, we will convert the time unit because the time unit is different. "
